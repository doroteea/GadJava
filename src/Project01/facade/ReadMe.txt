The facade pattern is appropriate when we have a complex system that we want to expose to clients in a simplified way.
Its purpose is to hide internal complexity behind a single interface that appears simple from the outside.
Facade also decouples the code that uses the system from the details of the subsystems, making it easier to modify the system later.

Facade pattern in my example oversimplifies the process of taking care of a castle.
When we think of castle's maintenance we may only think that well the servants only do the work.

 Well it is more than that, internally there is a lot going on when taking care of a castle.
 However, the facade object provides a simplifies interface to not let us know all the stuff going on: morning, the day , and evening.
